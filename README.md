# Model Evaluation Task-2
Model Evaluation is about testing a Machine learning model makes good guesses. it helps us see if the model works well or needs improvement before we use it.
## Why We Do It

Imagine the model is like a student learning to answer questions. After it learns, we give it a test to see if it understands. This test tells us if the model can give good answers in real life.

## How We Test the Model
Train and Test Data: We teach the model with one part of the data (training), and then we check it with new data it hasn’t seen (testing).
Check Performance: We look at how often the model gets the answers right. This helps us know if it’s doing well.
Look at Mistakes: We check what the model got wrong to see where it can improve.

### What We Do After Testing

If the model does well, we can start using it. If it doesn’t, we may need to train it more or make changes.
